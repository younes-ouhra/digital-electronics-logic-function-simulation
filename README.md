# Digital Electronics - Logic Function Simulation
## About
<p>This project was built along with the Laboratory Digital Electronics at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Regensburg (OTH Regensburg), Bavaria, Germany. The simulation of the following logic function with AMD Vivado is the focus of the project.</p>

## Simulation
After creating a testbench for this project, you can see how the output Y (as digital signal) changes depending on the status of the digital signals (as inputs) A, B, C and D.
